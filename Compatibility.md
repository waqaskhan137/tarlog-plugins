# Compatibility #

## Version 1.4.2 ##

I have actively used the 1.4.2 on the following Eclipse releases:

  * Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler)
  * Eclipse 4.2 (Juno)
  * Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)
  * Eclipse 3.6 (Helios)
  * Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo)

All the test were done on Windows OS.
Since 2011 I'm running Eclipse mostly on Windows 7 both 32 and 64 bit.
